Our main purpose is to recognize hand gestures from a video sequence and then train computer to perform motions using that.

1- To recognize the gestures from a live video , we need to take out the hand region removing unwanted portion in the video sequence.
So ,
	i- Find and segment the hand region.
	ii - For testing count the number of fingers in your hand.

	i- Segmentation

		A- Background Subtraction- running average of 30 frames is the background. Concept is simple (background with hand - background without hand)

		running average formula -> dst(x,y)=(1−a).dst(x,y)+a.src(x,y)

		B- Motion Detection and Thresholding - we need to threshold other part so that only our hand appears. i.e make hand part pixels as 0 and other as 1 or vice versa depends on you.

		C- Contour Extraction- Contour is the boundary of an object . so largest area contour is considered as our hand.

2- After segregating hand from backgroung we count fingers.
	
Step 1 – Find the convex hull of the arm. Convex hull are the points which when joined is of minimum area inside which all x and y coordinates of hand are present.

Step 2- Take extreme top, bottom, left and right convex hull points.

Step 4- Using euclidean distance calculate maximum distance and with that calculate radius of a hypothetical circle . The radius is taken as 80% of the maximum distance

Step 5- take out the circle coinciding with palm and fingers using bitwise and operation between the hand and the circle

Step 6- compute the bounding box of contour.# increment the count of fingers only if -
1. The contour region is not the wrist (bottom area)
2. The number of points along the contour does not exceed 25% of the circumference of the circular ROI
